# Professional README Generator

## Description

In this project I created a Readme generator that quickly creates a professional Readme for a new project.

## Installation

* Created command line application that accepts user input.
* Through node index js a series of question prompts will appear.
* When each prompt is answered, each will be added to a generated Readme file.
* When all questions are answered, a message will appear reading Your Readme file is now generated.
* Readme has been generated and added to utils folder.
